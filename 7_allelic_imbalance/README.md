## Main 
This directory contains scripts for allelic imbalance calculation. Allelic count differences were analyzed for each non-coding sSNP using two approaches: (1) a 500 bp window centered on the sSNP as the candidate cis-regulatory element (cCRE) target region in the snATAC-seq data, and (2) all exons located within a 500 kb region surrounding each sSNP in the snRNA-seq data. For each subject, read counts from both snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq were corrected for GC content and target region depth. Allelic imbalance was then quantified using the Combined Haplotype Test (CHT) implemented in WASP (https://github.com/bmvdgeijn/WASP/tree/master/CHT).
